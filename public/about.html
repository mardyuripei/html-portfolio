<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Marj! I'm a fulltime working mom of 5, 3 by blood, 2 by heart.
  <br/>
I work fulltime as an Executive Assistant to the CEO and my tasks include building WordPress websites, which opened this whole world of programming/developing/coding for me. 

  <br/> 
  I also do side hustles like video editing and social media managing. 
</p>

<p>When I'm not working, I take time to study and upskill.
  <br/>
  I like to study about animations, content ideas, and my latest addiction, programming.
</p>

<p>My goal is to develop my own software that I and my current client, whom I value a lot, will launch next year. By God's grace, I pray and I hope that when I come back to read this page, I have developed or launched our product.</p>

<H2>Jehovah Jireh!</H2>
